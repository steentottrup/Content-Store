### About

Content Store is a headless (decoupled) content management system.

A regular web content management system normally includes these 3 things:

- Content storage.
- A web UI for administrating the content.
- A web front-end, rendering the content to a browser.

The headless or decoupled content management system does not tied itself up with transforming/rendering the content into a certain format, so instead it includes these 3 things:

- Content storage.
- A web UI for administrating the content.
- An Api for accessing the content.

Content Store will include a rendering engine for getting the content into a browser, but this is not an essential part of the core.
